Orange Brownies
===============

These taste like a chocolate orange.

Have you ever wandered out into an orange grove, sunshine warming your hair, alligators singing peacefully in the swamp nearby with their loud low hum? I have not, and you won't find an elaborate backstory about the first time I ate an orange, then the first time I had a chocolate orange, and how a chocolate orange is nothing like a real orange but somehow is supposed to conjure up thoughts about the holidays. However, I will give you a recipe:

Stuff:
-----
Wet ingredients:
1 c granulated sugar
1 c brown sugar 
1/2 c neutral oil
1/2 c melted butter 
2 tsp orange extract 
4 eggs

Dry ingredients:
1/2 c all purpose flour 
1/2 c hazelnut flour 
1/2 tsp kosher salt
2/3 c cocoa powder 
1 tsp baking powder 
1 tsp espresso powder 

Directions:
----------
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
Prepare a 9 by 13 metal pan. Only do grease if you like to claw the brownies out with your hands and don't mind that some of it sticks, otherwise grease and line with parchment paper.
Get two bowls.
Mix the dry ingredients together in one bowl.
Mix the wet ingredients together in another bowl.
Mix the wet and dry ingredients together.
Pour contents into prepared pan.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Let cool fully if you want nice clean brownies. Don't if you're a gremlin.
Cut the brownies.
Eat.
