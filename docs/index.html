          <p>I'm Carolyn, currently the *nix sysadmin for Astronomy the KICP and a part-time grad student working on my master's degree in liberal arts at the University of Chicago.<br>

I have various interests such as painting, gardening, cooking with weird ingredients, playing 'Old Macdonald" on the hammered dulcimer (it's the only song I know), and listening to podcasts about esoteric things -- but don't ask me about current pop culture because I'm not hip with it.<br>

I might add more here, but I also might not.
