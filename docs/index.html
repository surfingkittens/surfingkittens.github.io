          <p>I'm Carolyn, a systems administrator supporting research and classroom instruction for the physical sciences at the University of Chicago. The website that I've inherited and am in the process of reviving for my department is <a href="https://itsupport.uchicago.edu">itsupport.uchicago.edu</a>, although I'm nowhere near done yet as priority-wise it's more of a pet project. I run primarily FreeBSD and CentOS, although I do have experience in other operating systems. My infrastructure includes webservers, mail servers, research machines, databases, virtualization, and much more. I also occasionally fix the coffee machine.
