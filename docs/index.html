          <p>I'm Carolyn, the systems administrator for the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago. Prior to that, I was working in the Department of Computer Science, also at the University of Chicago. I am a UNIX admin and run primarily FreeBSD and CentOS, although I am trying to move over to Debian. My infrastructure includes webservers, mail servers, research machines, databases, a virtualization cluster, and much more. I also occasionally fix the coffee machine.<br>
